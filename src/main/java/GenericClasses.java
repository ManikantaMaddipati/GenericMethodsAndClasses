public class GenericClasses {
    //Generic classes provide a means for describing the concept
    // of a stack (or any other class) in a type-independent manner.
    //We can then instantiate type-specific objects of the generic class.
    // Generics provide a nice opportunity for software reusability.

    //At compilation time:
    //1. the compiler ensures the type safety of your code.
    //2. uses the erasure techniques to enable your client code to interact with the generic class.
